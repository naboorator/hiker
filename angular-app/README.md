# AngularApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 22.1.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

The API must also be running on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm run api:dev
```

On the first successful connection, existing IndexedDB settings, activities, and weight measurements are copied to the API without changing their IDs. IndexedDB is retained as a local migration backup, while all subsequent reads and writes use the API.

Register an account in the application and then log in. The frontend sends its bearer token automatically, and the API returns only that user's settings, activities, and weight measurements.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
